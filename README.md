## Exercises Still Need to Finish:

### Exercise #4
Objective: Asynchronous Observer with Destructuring

Instructions:

***Note: I WANT the data from the link added as the response given when the observers are passing

2. The data passed to each observer's update method should be the list of posts fetched.

3. Handle potential errors using a try/catch block. If an error occurs, invoke the update method of observers with an appropriate error message.

4. Within the Observer class's update method, destructure the received posts to log the title of the first post. If an error message is received instead, just log it.

5. Instantiate the Subject, add multiple observers, call fetchAndNotify(), and ensure each observer logs the title of the first post or an error message.

### Questions:

1. Why are my collapsed groups in the console above the Async/Await response? Is there a way to group this?
